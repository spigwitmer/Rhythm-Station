= Rhythm-Station =
Rhythm-Station (RStation) is intended to be a music game (like StepMania) which
is as flexible as possible, with support for many game modes and even defining
your own without slaving away in the source code.

While the theming capabilities are planned to be extensive, note that knowledge
of Lua will be required to get anything meaningful done.

== Compiling on OS X ==
Compile should "just work" with Xcode 4.1, Xcode 3.2.6 should work if you can
get the OS X 10.7 SDK working. 10.5 and 10.6 aren't supported currently due to
the renderer only supporting OpenGL 3.2, which was introduced in 10.7.

== Compiling on Linux/gcc ==
# Make sure that you have following installed:
#* autotools
#* cmake (glfw3 git source needs this)
#* gl, glew
#* libpng (zlib as dependency of libpng)
#* openal, vorbisfile, fftw3
#* sqlite3
#* xrandr
#* >=lua-5.1 (optional, if you don't have it just pass <code>--with-bundled-lua</code> to the configure script)
# Clone current git head with command: <code>git clone git://github.com/shakesoda/Rhythm-Station.git rstation</code>
# Run <code>./autogen.sh</code> to download and build the glfw submodule and prepare automake.
# Run <code>./configure</code>
# If everything went well, you can now run <code>make</code>
# After compiling, <code>./rstation</code>

Ubuntu users need to have atleast these packages installed 
in order to compile rstation:
build-essential, autoconf, libglew1.5-dev, cmake, libxrandr-dev, libpng-dev, 
libopenal-dev, libfftw3-dev, libvorbis-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libsqlite3-dev,  
liblua5.1-0-dev (optional)

== Hacking ==
Have at it! Coding style changes with the wind, avoid having singletons all
over the place. Dependency injection is preferred, using namespaces is
encouraged. Please avoid using features which MSVC doesn't support, even if
the project files either don't exist or are outdated.
