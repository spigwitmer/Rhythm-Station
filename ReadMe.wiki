== Compiling ==
You shouldn't have any trouble building with MSVC 2008 - provided the project
files are up to date. The Xcode project is almost always up to date and should
work just fine at any given time (unless otherwise noted).

[*] Note: due to some major changes there aren't any VC project files currently.
 Hopefully in the next week or so we'll get/make some. [2010/10/27]

== Development ==
Don't worry about adding stubs and hacks - just try to get the job done and get
to it later. Currently the code is rather messy and I am working to improve it
and flesh out some of the stubs. As for coding style, just follow the source
in the file you're in, generally I write code like so:

<pre>
/*
 * Multi-line comment.
 * Hello there.
 */
void foo(int _bar) : baz()
{
	baz = _bar;

	// * on the right
	int *pVar = new int[1];
	delete pVar;

	// omit braces for single-line ifs
	if (foo == bar)
		baz(1, 2, SOME_ENUM);
}

class Test : public Stuff
{
public:
	Test();
	virtual ~Test();
};
</pre>

Variables should be named in such a way that they make sense. There is no need
to strictly follow hungarian notation or whatever else. Public functions should
be CamelCase (or for getters/setters: setCamelCase).

The code is rather inconsistent right now, I apologize.

== Compiling on Linux/gcc ==
  1. Make sure that you have following installed:
    - autotools
    - cmake (glfw3 git source needs this)
    - gl, glew
    - libpng (zlib as dependency of libpng)
    - openal, vorbisfile, fftw3
    - sqlite3
    - xrandr
    - >=lua-5.1 (optional, if you don't have it just 
      pass --with-bundled-lua to the configure script)
  2. Clone current git head with command:
       git clone git://github.com/shakesoda/Rhythm-Station.git rstation
  3. Run "./autogen.sh" to download and build the glfw submodule and prepare
     automake.
  4. Run "./configure"
  5. If everything went well, you can now run "make"
  6. After compiling, "./rstation"

Ubuntu users need to have atleast these packages installed 
in order to compile rstation:
build-essential, autoconf, libglew1.5-dev, cmake, libxrandr-dev, libpng-dev, 
libopenal-dev, libfftw3-dev, libvorbis-dev, libfreetype6-dev, libsqlite3-dev,  
liblua5.1-0-dev (optional)
