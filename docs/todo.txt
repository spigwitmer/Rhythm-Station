TODO: (note: not complete, of course)
Essential:
- Font support
	- Needed for menus and such.
	- Needed for on-screen stats.
	- Needed for text, obviously.
- Menu screens
	- Make the game do something!
- Support for loading some note format
	- Doesn't really matter which.
- Gameplay (!)
	- The point.
	- Depends on supporting a note format, really.
	- We'll need a way to ensure things stay synced eventually.
- Scripting
	- Lua support exists, but is very, very primitive and not very useful
		at the moment.
	- I don't particularly know how to go about most of this. - Colby

Convenient:
- Organization
	- The source folder is messy
	- Things should probably be renamed to be more consistent and/or
		more descriptive.
	- The window callbacks really shouldn't be in InputManager. That's bad.
- Threading
	- Namely for keeping audio from dropping out and input accurate.
	- Threaded loading would be good (ideally, the screen could continue
		updating during a loading screen and still go faster than if it
		were single-threaded).
- OBJ loader should come back

Buggy/bad behavior:
- Resizing the window causes things to be scaled wrong. Weird!
- Audio drops out if anything causes the game to stall (resizing, loading, etc)
- Preferences added when there is an existing Preferences.ini don't get added.
