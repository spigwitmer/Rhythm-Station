Directory design idea (at least for linux)
------------------------------------------

Global rstation files
  - data [/usr/share/rstation/]
    * shaders
    * etc.
  - shared user files [/var/lib/rstation/]
    * user profiles
    * global preferences (system defaults)
  - user files [~/.rstation/]
    * user overriden preferences
  
Game specific files 
  - data [/usr/share/rstation/games/<gameid>/]
    * themes
    * songs
    * etc.
  - shared user files [/var/lib/rstation/games/<gameid>/]
    * high scores etc.
  - user files [~/.rstation/games/<gameid>/]
    *
