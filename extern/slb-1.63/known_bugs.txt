KNOWN BUGS
----------

On windows the standard iterator API to register methods from standar stl containers, can not
be wrapped directly. To wrapp those methods the full specification of the method it's needed.
To illustrate this see tests/unit_001.cpp

On windows iterators API should not be used, it is being developed and tested and it is not meant
to be used right now.
